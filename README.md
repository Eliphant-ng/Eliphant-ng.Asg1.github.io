#  ✨ _**My Personal Portfolio**_ ✨

#### Hello I am Elicia! For my first ID-Assignment I would be creating a personal portfolio site. 
#### Currently I am a year one Polytechnic student pursuing a Diploma in Immersive Media. In this website I would be introducing more about myself, showing so of my highlights and showcasing some of my personal works that have done so far in my NP Polytechnic journey as well. Sit back and enjoy! 😎

## _**Design Process**_: 🎨

*  As a programmer, I want to showcase more of my works, so that I can be recognised by potential clients in the future. 
*  As a student, I want to use this platform to further enhance my skills, so that i can become more skillful and fluent in HTML.
*  As a creator, I want to create a well done personal portfolio, so that I can proudly use this portfolio for my interviews in the future. 
*  As a programmer, I would like to make my website as unique and creative as possible, so that my website would be able to stand out and grab audiences's attention.
